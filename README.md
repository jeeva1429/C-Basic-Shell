# C-Basic-Shell

This is a personal learning project where I'm building a basic shell in C to deepen my understanding of Unix-like operating systems and strengthen my C programming skills.

### Features
- Executes basic Unix commands using `execvp`
- Handles user input and basic command parsing
-  Stdin/Stdout Redirection (`>`, `<`)

### Feature in progress
- Piping (`|`)

  
### Upcoming features
- Background processes (`&`)
- Support for more built-in commands (`cd`, `pwd`, etc.)
